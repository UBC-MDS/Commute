## Intriguing question:

Does staying off-campus or on-campus influence a person's self-rated experience of the MDS program ?

## Plan of statistical analysis

In this survey, we would test whether the average MDS enjoyment level for students living on and off-campus are different using hypothesis testing.

Our null hypothesis is that there are no difference in enjoyment level between the two groups, our alternative hypothesis is that the two
group means are different. Tests are conducted at 5% significance level.
